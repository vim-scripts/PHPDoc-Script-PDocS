PHPDoc Script (PDocS) supports you in writing PHPDoc like comments while creating PHP-Source code. You don't need to copy/paste the 
Doc block over and over so you can create them while writing the source
code. This will result in better commets...;-)
The Script currently supports only one Styleguide.

I hope it helps...

I have created the script on Vim 6.1, but i think it should be running well
on Vim 6.0 too. I hope so...
